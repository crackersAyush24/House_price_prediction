## 🧩 Project Overview

This project aims to predict **real estate prices** using structured property data.  
It includes robust **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, and **model training** pipelines to ensure accurate and reliable predictions.  

The trained models are stored as `.pkl` files for easy deployment.  
A **Streamlit web interface** lets users input property details and get instant, model-driven price predictions.
