# 🏠 House Price Prediction

An end-to-end **Machine Learning** project that predicts house prices based on key property features such as **area, location, and amenities**.  
Built using **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**, and deployed via a sleek **Streamlit web app** for real-time predictions.

## 🧩 Project Overview

This project aims to predict **real estate prices** using structured property data.  
It includes robust **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, and **model training** pipelines to ensure accurate and reliable predictions.  

The trained models are stored as `.pkl` files for easy deployment.  
A **Streamlit web interface** lets users input property details and get instant, model-driven price predictions.

## ✨ Features

✅ Handles both **numerical** and **categorical** property features.  
✅ Performs **outlier removal** using percentile clipping to improve model stability.  
✅ Trains and compares **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** models.  
✅ Interactive **Streamlit** web app for live prediction.  
✅ Stores trained models and encoders in `.pkl` format for reuse.  
✅ Clean, modular, and well-documented code structure.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd House-Price-Prediction-main
````

2. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   # If requirements.txt not available:
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost streamlit
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

### 🏋️‍♂️ Train the Models

Run the main script to train models and generate serialized files:

```bash
python Main.py
```

This will create:

* `model_xgb.pkl` → XGBoost model
* `model.pkl` → Random Forest model
* `label_encoder.pkl` → Encodes categorical features
* `model_columns.pkl` → Stores model feature names

### 🌐 Launch the Web App

Start the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) in your browser.
Enter property details (like area, location, etc.) and get **real-time price predictions** instantly!
